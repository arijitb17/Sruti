        Today, you step out of the troubles and chaos you endured the past
        years. Today is the beginning of a brighter tomorrow. Your success and
        prosperity bring me peace, just as a kid finds amusement seeing
        glowing stars in the darkest night. You will come across every sort of
        situation along the way, so remember to enjoy while it lasts. I am
        sure you will do your best as always. And don't worry about anything;
        you will always have a friend in me‚ù§‚Äçü©π
